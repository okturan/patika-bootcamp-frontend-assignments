      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Douglas Noel Adams, born on March 11, 1952, in Cambridge, England, is best known for his science fiction series
        "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," a work that originally began as a BBC radio comedy in 1978. It later
        evolved into a "trilogy" of five books that have sold over 15 million copies worldwide, inspiring a whole
        generation of readers and creators in multiple media formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adams attended St John's College, Cambridge, where he earned a degree in English literature. During his time at
        Cambridge, he was also a member of the prestigious Footlights group, which opened the door to his career in
        radio and television. His early work included contributions to the British television series "Monty Python's
        Flying Circus."
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond his seminal "Hitchhiker's Guide" series, Adams created the "Dirk Gently" books, which combine elements of
        detective fiction with philosophical and scientific concepts, delivered with his characteristic wit and whimsy.
        The first two books in the series, "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency" and "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the
        Soul," were both critically acclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adams was an early adopter of technology and an enthusiastic proponent of personal computing, even co-founding
        The Digital Village, a digital media and technology company. He authored "Last Chance to See," a non-fiction
        work emphasizing environmental conservation alongside zoologist Mark Carwardine. They traveled around the world
        documenting endangered species, which Adams continued to support through his activism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tragically, Douglas Adams passed away from a heart attack on May 11, 2001, at the age of 49. Despite his
        untimely death, Adams’s work continues to inspire through its clever humor, innovative storytelling, and deep
        philosophical questions about life, the universe, and everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        An asteroid, 25924 Douglasadams, was named in his honor, and his legacy is celebrated annually on "Towel Day."
        Fans around the world carry a towel with them on May 25th, a tribute to Adams's work and a nod to one of the
        most memorable jokes from "The Hitchhiker's Guide."
